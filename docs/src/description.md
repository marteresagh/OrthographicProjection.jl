# Description
In this package you can find two main algorithms:
 - *segment* : allows you to clip the points of a 3D point cloud contained in a volume,
 - *orthophoto* : generates the image as orthographic projection of 3D point cloud (whole or clipped in a volume) with respect to a chosen plane

Both of them has the same **core function**, that takes as input a [point cloud Potree project](https://github.com/potree/potree) and a [cuboidal LAR model](https://github.com/cvdlab/LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl).

## Input Point Cloud
To manage a point cloud with huge number of points we use Potree project, achieved with the tool [PotreeConverter 1.7](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/tree/master).

### Potree
A Potree is a data structure used to store huge point clouds, based on octree. All details of this structure are described by Markus SchÃ¼tz in his [thesis](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2016/SCHUETZ-2016-POT/SCHUETZ-2016-POT-thesis.pdf).

A Potree project is a collection of files, for each node of the octree there is a file called r, followed by a numeric code indicating its position in the hierarchy, for example:
 - **r** is the root node,
 - **r0** is the first child of the root node,
 - **r07** is the eighth child of the first child of the root node.

Due to particular way of tagging nodes, it is possible store Potree in a trie data structure, provided by Julia in module `DataStructures.jl`. As the usual tree data structure, a trie is made up of collections of trie node. Every trie node has three components:
- a value, where store information: in our case the path to the (LAS or LAZ) file associated;
- a map, where key is a digit and the value is trie node, used to establish the parent-child relationship;
- boolean value, indicating the end of word. In our case `true` in each node.

## Core Function: Trie Traversal
To speed up the search for points falling within the region of interest we use trie to process the whole point cloud.
Each node of Potree is generated by the decomposition of space into congruent regions: the volume occupied by the octree node is described as an **AABB**, which we find in the header of the file associated with the node.
Assuming this, we only process nodes that intersect the volume.
There are three possible options of intersection:
 - `0` -> volume not intersect octree node (skip this node and all subtree)
 - `1` -> volume intersect, but not contains, octree node (process this node and check for his children)
 - `2` -> volume contains octree node (process this node and all subtree)

## Segment
All points falling within the region of interest are saved in a LAS file.

## Create image
TODO da riscrivere per bene ma ci siamo quasi

To create the image, i.e. the orthophoto, we generate a grid on the volume projection. the resolution is given by user e calcoliamo i valori di riferimento della matrice Xref e Yref (chi sono non ricordo) mettere figure per far capire
To proceed we have to take into account the color attribute of each point and the viewing place.
The viewing place, described by the projection plane, is the point from which the observator looks the point cloud.  
For each point falling within the region of interest, the color attribute RGB associated is saved in an 3-channel array and the distance to the viewing point is saved in a z-buffer. The final image is generated by the colors of the point that lie in a pixel near to observator.
