# Description

In this package you can find two main algorithms:
 - *segment*: allows you to separate the points of a 3D point cloud contained in a volume,
 - *orthophoto*: generates the image as orthographic projection of 3D point cloud with respect to a chosen plane

Both of them has the same core function.

## Input Point Cloud
To manage a point cloud with huge number of points we use Potree project, achieved with the tool [PotreeConverter 1.7](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/tree/master).

### Potree

A Potree is a data structure used to stored huge point clouds, based on octree. All details of this structure are described by Markus Sch√ºtz in his [thesis](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2016/SCHUETZ-2016-POT/SCHUETZ-2016-POT-thesis.pdf).

A Potree project is a collection of files, for each node of the octree there is a file called r, followed by a numeric code indicating its position in the hierarchy, for example:
 - r is the root node,
 - r0 is the first child of the root node,
 - r07 is the eighth child of the first child of the root node.


Due to particular way of tagging nodes, it is possible store Potree in a trie data structure, provided by Julia in module `DataStructures.jl`. As the usual tree data structure, a trie is made up of collections of trie node. Every trie node has three components:
- a value, where store information: in our case the path to the file associated;
- a map, where key is character and the value is trie node, used to establish the parent-child relationship;
- boolean value, indicating the end of word.
